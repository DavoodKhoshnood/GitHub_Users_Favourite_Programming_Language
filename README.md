# GitHub User's Favourite Programming Language

This application allows users to enter an arbitrary GitHub username and be presented with the best guess of the GitHub user's favourite programming language.

I've used https://api.github.com/users/username/repos API in the Detail component to get repos' languages that signify the most-used programming language in the repos. If no languages are detected that would be null.

### Documentation
